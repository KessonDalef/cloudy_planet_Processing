# Cloudy Planet

![Cloudy Planet, frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KessonDalef/cloudy_planet/master/preview/preview.gif)

A GLSL experiment involving 3D Fractional Brownian Motion and Domain Warping to simulate a planet similar to Earth.

It was inspired by two articles by Inigo Quilez, which can be found [here](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm) and [here](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fbm/fbm.htm) while reading [The Book Of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/) 

[Live version](https://kesson.io/experiments/cloudyplanet)

I ported this in processing from my original version made in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) (follow the link above to see the WebGL version).

## Test
